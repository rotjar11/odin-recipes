    <h2>Description</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This is Brazilian favorite (and an old family recipe), and takes no cooking at all. It's a little tart and tangy for those of you who don't like your desserts to be too sweet.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 passion fruits</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>

    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>

    <li>2 cups cream</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1:<br>Break passion fruits in half, and empty contents into a bowl. Use a little water to help rinse the juice out of the skins. <br>Mix with hands to soften pulp. Strain through a sieve or cheesecloth. Stir in sugar and sweetened condensed milk.</li>
        <li>Step 2:<br>In a chilled bowl, beat cream until stiff peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the passion fruit mixture, then quickly fold in remaining cream until no streaks remain. Refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
